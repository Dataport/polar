# CHANGELOG

## unpublished

- Breaking: MoveHandle can now only be rendered once which is done in `@polar/core`. Please refer to the documentation of `@polar/core` on how to use this component.
- Feature: MoveHandle now remembers the previous position and sets it to the next content, if it doesn't exceed the maximum height.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.
