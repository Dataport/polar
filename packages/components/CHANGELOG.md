# CHANGELOG

## unpublished

- Feature: Add new prop `useDefaultIcons` accompanied by the props `closeLabel` and `closeFunction` to `MoveHandle`. Using them adds an icon and a button above the content, giving a visual indicator for the user and an option to close the content directly from the MoveHandle.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.
