# Measure

## Scope

The tool offers measuring distances and areas as multi-point lines and polygons.

## Configuration

There are currently no configurable parameters to this plugin. It always offers modes (Select/Draw/Edit/Delete), a switch to measure either distances or areas, a unit selection (m/km), and an RGB colour selection for text and lines displayed regarding measurements.

## Caveats

The tool is not yet configurable and may yield unexpected behaviour when used in combination with the plugins Draw and Pins, as some interactions do overlap. The colouring tool requires a basic understanding of RGB colour mixing. You can easily offer this tool to expert users, but it may confuse regular users.
