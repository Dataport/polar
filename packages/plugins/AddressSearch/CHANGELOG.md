# CHANGELOG

## 1.1.0

- Feature: Add aria-description to the input for improved accessibility.
- Feature: Render results as a native html list.
- Feature: Change navigation of search results to use arrow keys instead of tabbing. If multiple groups are configured, the expand buttons can be navigated via arrow keys as well as tabbing. This should improve the usability for large result lists.
- Feature: Add configuration parameter `focusAfterSearch` to be able to focus on the first result after a successful search.
- Fix: Hide results if they are rendered as part of a group and the results exceed the configured limited amount.
- Fix: Documentation error regarding plugin state.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.
