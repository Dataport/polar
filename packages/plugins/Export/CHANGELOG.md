# CHANGELOG

## unpublished

- Chore: The dependency `jspdf` was updated from `^2.5.2` to `^4.0.0` due to a [security issue](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF/security/advisories/GHSA-f8cm-6447-x5h2). The security issue did not affect POLAR builds, and no further action is required.

## 1.2.2

- Chore: Update `@polar/lib-custom-types` to `v2.0.0`.

## 1.2.1

## 1.1.0
