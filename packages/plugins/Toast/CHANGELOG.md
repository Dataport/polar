# CHANGELOG

## unpublished

- Breaking: As a result of the bundling with `rollup`, the styles of the package need to be imported via `@polar/plugin-toast/styles.css`.
- Feature: The package is now being bundled by `rollup` before being published. This allows for a smaller package size and better compatibility with other packages.
- Fix: Adjust documentation to properly describe optionality of configuration parameters.

## 1.1.0

## 1.0.1
