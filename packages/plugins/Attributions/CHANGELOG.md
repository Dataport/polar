# CHANGELOG

## 1.1.0

- Feature: Add link to repository and license as required by EUPL v1.2.
- Feature: Include title in AttributionContent so users receive this information on all devices.
- Feature: `max-width` and `width` are now only set on the content if `renderType` is `independent` as the mobile view is rendered in the `MoveHandle`.
- Fix: Attributions are now being translated when the window is open.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.
