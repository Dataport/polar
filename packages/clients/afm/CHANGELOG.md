# CHANGELOG

- Breaking: Update `@polar`-dependencies to the latest versions. This includes an update of `ol` from `^7.1.0` to `^10.3.1`.
- Feature: This client now supports the `@polar/core`'s field `stylePath`. The usage is documented in the API.md file.
- Feature: Update icon of `layerChooser` in `iconMenu` to `fa-layer-group` to clear-up the content hidden behind the menu button.
- Chore: Change value of `pins.movable` configuration to `'drag'` as using a boolean has been deprecated.
