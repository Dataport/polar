# POLAR client TextLocator

## Content

The TextLocator client offers usage of the TextLocator backend that allows searching for papers in a geospatial fashion; that is, selecting a region will produce a list of papers found regarding that region.

Please see the CHANGELOG.md for all changes after the initial release.

## Usage

The product is a hostable HTML page. The included index.js file contains the default configuration.

It's also possible to directly import and use the client `client-text-locator.js`; however, this is currently neither tested nor documented. Should the client with matching documentation be required in such a way that further modifications can be made or that the client can used embedded in a page, contact us.
