# TextLocator MapClient API üó∫Ô∏è `@polar/client-text-locator`

There is no API to this package; it is not configurable, but delivers a hostable website containing the client in question. All reconfiguration must be done in the source code and requires a new build.

When configuring before building, please mind that the `index.html` in the source folder contains configuration parameters that are later bundled.

For all additional details, check the [full documentation](https://dataport.github.io/polar/docs/textLocator/client-textLocator.html).
