# TextLocator MapClient API 🗺️ `@polar/client-text-locator`

There is no API to this package; it is not configurable, but delivers a hostable website containing the client in question. All reconfiguration must be done in the source code and require a new build.

When configuring before building, please mind that the `index.html` in the source folder contains configuration parameters that are later bundled.
