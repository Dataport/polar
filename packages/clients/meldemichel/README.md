# POLAR client Meldemichel

## Content

The Meldemichel map client is used by citizens in Hamburg to report on damage of public infrastructure and view reports of other citizens.

Please see the `CHANGELOG.md` for all changes after the initial release.

## Usage

The client comes in different flavours. There exists a view for officials in charge, for citizens during reporting, and for citizens as a general overview. While the first two clients are delivered as usable javascript packages and are used within the AfM infrastructure, the last one is delivered as a full HTML page.

For details on usage as a package, please refer to the accompanying `API.md`. Usage as a HTML page is simply offered by hosting the client package with the included .html file.
