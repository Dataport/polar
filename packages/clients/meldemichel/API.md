# Meldemichel MapClient API üó∫Ô∏è `@polar/client-meldemichel`

This client is based on [POLAR](https://github.com/Dataport/polar) and subsequently the [masterportalAPI](https://bitbucket.org/geowerkstatt-hamburg/masterportalapi/src/master/). The following documentation only contains how this specific client can be used, and the minimal information required to get it running.

For all additional details, check the [full documentation](https://dataport.github.io/polar/docs/meldemichel/client-meldemichel.html).

For the development test deployments, [see here](./example/index.html).

## Basic usage

The NPM package `@polar/client-meldemichel` can be installed via NPM or downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/Dataport/polar/releases). When using `import mapClient from '@polar/client-meldemichel'`, the object `mapClient` contains a method `createMap`. This is the main method required to get the client up and running. Should you use another import method, check the package's `dist` folder for available files.

The method expects a single object with the following parameters.

| fieldName | type | description |
| - | - | - |
| containerId | string | ID of the container the map is supposed to render itself to. |
| mode | enum["REPORT", "SINGLE", "COMPLETE"] | See chapters below for an overview of the modes. |
| afmUrl | string? | `COMPLETE` mode only. The URL used here is the URL of the AfM service to open to create a new damage report. |
| reportServiceId | string? | `COMPLETE` mode only. ID of the report layer to display. Both the Filter and the Feature List will work with this layer. The client will also provide tooltips and cluster the features. |
| configOverride  | object? | This can be used to override the configuration of any installed plugin; see full documentation. It is also used to set initial pins in `SINGLE` mode. See documentation of `SINGLE` further below. |

It returns a Promise of a map instance. This returned instance is required to retrieve information from the map.

The package also includes a `style.css` and an `index.html` file. The `style.css`'s relative path must, if it isn't the default value `'./style.css'`, be included in the `configOverride` as follows:

```js
{
  // ...
  configOverride: {
    stylePath: '../the/relative/path/style.css'
  }
}
```

The value to `stylePath` is the same as as a `link` tag would have in its `href`.

The `index.html` is used in `COMPLETE` mode, which is not run in the AfM. You may, however, use it for testing or inspecting an example.

### Instance reuse

The `mapInstance` and its HTML environment are kept in the client; it is returned and rerendered on subsequent `createMap` calls to a div with the given `id`. Due to this, everything will appear to the user as it was previously left, including opened menus.

Since in `SINGLE` mode, changes to the pins are required between renders, hence the parameters in `configOverride.pins` are used to update the client. Should additional updates be required, please let us know.

Calling `watch`/`subscribe` on the client will return an `unwatch`/`unsubscribe` method. It should be called on leaving the map's page; depending on framework/library in e.g. the `beforeDestroy` or `beforeUnmount` method.

## Rendering in SINGLE or REPORT mode

A document rendering the map client could e.g. look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>REPORT EXAMPLE</title>
    <style>
      #meldemichel-map-client {
        min-width: 320px;
        max-width: 930px;
        height: 500px;
        position: relative;
        margin: 5px;
        -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="meldemichel-map-client">
      <!-- Optional, may use if your page does not have its own <noscript> information -->

## Rendering COMPLETE mode

The `index.html` included in the package's `dist` folder has been prepared for this mode and must merely be hosted.

Please see the table in chapter `Basic usage` about configuration options.
