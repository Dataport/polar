# CHANGELOG

## 1.1.2

- Chore: Fix bugs via dependency updates.
  - resolve filter bugs for features of unknown filter categories; they were sometimes visible

## 1.1.1

- Chore: Fix bugs via dependency updates.
  - restore Safari 15 compatibility
  - resolve time filter bugs where selected time frame was applied incorrectly

## 1.1.0

- Change: The search now no longer focuses on the first result after a successful search.

## 1.0.0

Initial release. ðŸŽ‰

## 1.0.0-beta.7

- Fix: Use `@polar/plugins-pins@1.3.1` to fix the map getting dragged along with the pin in some situations.

## 1.0.0-beta.6

- Feature: Add `@polar/plugin-address-search` and `@polar/plugin-reverse-geocoder` to mode `SINGLE`.

## 1.0.0-beta.5

- Fix: Add missing API.md change. No further changes to previous version.

## 1.0.0-beta.4

- Fix: The previously proclaimed SPA-readiness was erroneous in that a memory leak occurred due to the client not being garbage-collectable. This has been resolved by reusing the map entirely instead of setting up a new one. Given configuration regarding pins is interpreted despite reuse.
- Change: The main library file is no longer published as `.mjs`, but as `.js` file. This is due to internal tooling updates. A rename of the import suffices.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

- Fix: The gazetteer search returned confusing results. This was due to a wildcard option that allowed the return of imprecise matches. This has been deactivated since it tended to result in more confusion than it was helpful. The search now works as it does in the previous Meldemichel implementation.

## 1.0.0-beta.2

- Feature: This client now supports the `@polar/core`'s field `stylePath`. The usage is documented in the API.md file.
- Feature: Update icon of `layerChooser` in `iconMenu` to `fa-layer-group` to clear-up the content hidden behind the menu button.
- Feature: Update the close-button of the GFI window to indicate more clearly that it leads to the FeatureList.
- Feature: Move attributions from the `iconMenu` to the bottom-right, use a smaller icon and a different colour to clear-up the secondary nature of the content.
- Feature: The client is now SPA-ready. The `API.md` has been extended with example code.
- Fix: Size and colours of GFI navigation arrows have been aligned to neighbouring items in mobile mode.
- Fix: Fixed an issue on narrow devices sometimes showing undefined content in the gfi after clicking somewhere in the map where no feature is present.

## 1.0.0-beta.1

- Fix: The modes `SINGLE` and `REPORT` falsely ran the GFI plugin dependent upon configuration only available in `COMPLETE` mode. This issue has been resolved.

## 1.0.0-beta.0

Beta release. Feature-complete, but some known (and unknown?) bugs remain.

- Feature: Add features for `COMPLETE` mode:
  - Feature List
  - AfM Button
  - Filter
  - Mobile views for small devices
- Fix: The listenable `mapState` field `vendor_maps_position` has been changed in its formatting. It now matches the formatting of the neighbouring `mapCenter` field (`number,number`) instead of being an array.
- Fix: The listenable `mapState` field `vendor_maps_address_to` has been renamed to `vendor_maps_distance_to` to match the previous name.
