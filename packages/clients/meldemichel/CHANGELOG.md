# CHANGELOG

## unpublished

- Feature: Adding `AfmButton` for `COMPLETE` mode to open AfM process.
- Fix: The listenable `mapState` field `vendor_maps_position` has been changed in its formatting. It now matches the formatting of the neighbouring `mapCenter` field (`number,number`) instead of being an array.
- Fix: The listenable `mapState` field `vendor_maps_address_to` has been renamed to `vendor_maps_distance_to` to match the previous name.

## 1.0.0-alpaka.0

Test release. Feature-complete for AfM integration.
