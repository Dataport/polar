# Example structure

## `.`

The root folder holds files used in all clients. Modify with care. If you need wildly different files for an example, create new files in the relevant example folder.

## `dev`

This folder holds the development example used during development time. You may put anything in here as long as it serves the testing purposes. The client is not required to look good, but is a technical playground.

## all others

All other folders are examples used in the documentation deployed on the GitHub page. They are supposed to display usage variants and should be understandable/clean. These are supposed to be viewn both by the customer and integrators alike so that they can easily lift from the usage scenarios. They're also useful for testing PRs in build mode.
