# CHANGELOG

## unpublished

- Breaking: Change name of exported style file from `polar-client.css` to `style.css`. This is to be consistent with documentation of `@polar/core` and this client.
- Feature: Directly expose `createMap` to be able to import it directly when using this client.
- Chore: Update `@polar`-dependencies to the latest versions.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.
