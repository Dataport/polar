# CHANGELOG

## unpublished

- Feature: Update icon of `layerChooser` in `iconMenu` to `fa-layer-group` to clear-up the content hidden behind the menu button.
- Chore: Various small changes to keep up with library updates.

NOTE Before next release, dependencies must be set to versions. AddressSearch *must* be set to a minimum version `>1.1.0` (above, not at least). This is due to DISH previously requiring an undocumented property (available direct store import & usage) that no longer holds; DISH has already been adapted to the newer implementation in versions `>1.1.0`. After setting, delete this NOTE before publishing.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.
