# Snowbox API Documentation

This is an API file that is used as part of the generated documentation. It will appear as main document in the snowbox's documentation.

If the snowbox implemented any own features that are not derived from either core of plugins, this would be the place to document them. However, since that's not the case, it only features this introduction text and the link list below.

For all additional details, check the [full documentation](https://dataport.github.io/polar/docs/snowbox/client-snowbox.html).
