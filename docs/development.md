# Development

Hint:
Developing yourself is optional.
POLAR supplies ready-made clients for many use cases, and you may commission us to write additional features.

## Where to code
POLAR clients run everywhere.
To develop plugins and clients anew, a certain setup is required.
To avoid redoing it, it is advised to create additional plugins and clients in a fork of the project.

There are no further requirements.
If you aim to merge back, please contact us before starting to put in work.

TODO: Update this section, especially for clients

## Required skills
Depending on what exactly you plan to write anew, the required skills may vary.
POLAR is a purely front-end solution and as such general knowledge about web development is advisable.

We are especially writing the client with the following libraries, to which additional knowledge is helpful for contributions.
