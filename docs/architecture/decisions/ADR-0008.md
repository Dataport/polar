# Configuration parameters in tables have to be ordered by a) required and b) alphabetically.

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

If a developer is reading the docs, having the configuration parameters order first by required values then alphabetically makes it easier to find relevant parameters.

## Decision

All docs shall be sorted as proposed.

## Consequences

* (+) Better readability of documentation.
* (+) Clear placement of new parameters.
* (-) This restriction must be manually enforced.
