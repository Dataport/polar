# Error toasts have to be dismissed manually

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Information relevant for the user is displayed in toasts which close automatically after a custom timeout.

## Decision

A timeout set for toasts that contain error messages will be ignored. Such toasts can only be closed manually by clicking the close button.

## Consequences

* (+) The user is forced to handle error messages and thus is more aware of errors that occur.
