# `console` statement standardization

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

In production environments it may seem unclear if an error or warning message is shown in the console from which part of the application they occurred.

## Decision

All `console.warn` and `console.error` messages have to show the application's part in which they are invoked.
We add the location to the console messages at compile-time using Vite.

## Consequences

* (+) Errors and warnings can more easily be tracked back to the place in which they occur.
* (+) This restriction is enforced automatically.
* (-) Console messages are more verbose.
