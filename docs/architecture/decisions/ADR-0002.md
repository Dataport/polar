# Plugin-based architecture

## Status

Revoked by ADR 0009.

## Context

With recurring requirements, a desire grows to avoid repetition and reuse components. This can be implemented with a plugin-based architecture to create new map clients and have the most common features already done.

## Decision

An architecture for the client has been designed that models how we get to re-use functionality without re-writing it while still being open for extensions. The following graphic explains the architecture in further detail.

## Consequences

* (+) Higher quality of features since multiple parties use them.
* (+) Implement once, use multiple times.
* (+) Parts are easier to exchange/develop, and not all clients are required to update immediately.
* (-) More difficult to understand the codebase.
