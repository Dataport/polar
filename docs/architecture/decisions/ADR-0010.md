# Manage ADRs with Git

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Currently, ADRs are managed in a single GitHub wiki page of POLAR.

## Decision

We move the ADRs to the repository in a documentation folder. We write one file per ADR.

## Consequences

- (+) Changes to ADRs can more comfortably be tracked via Git.
- (o) There is more overhead in creating and updating ADRs, which may lead to writing less of them.
