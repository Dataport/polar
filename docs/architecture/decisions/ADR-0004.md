# Vuex mutations have no map side effects

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

OL Map interactions are usually side effects by nature, but are not asynchronous. It was unclear whether such changes belong to actions or mutations.

## Decision

It has been decided that map side effects do not belong to mutations, but to actions.

## Consequences

* (+) Mutations stay clean of side effects.
* (+) On potential extension of such map calls, asynchronous behaviour may be required; in that case, actions are already the correct position.
* (-) This restriction must be manually enforced.
