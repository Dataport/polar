# We write ADRs from now on

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

As time goes by, it becomes unclear whether architectural decisions have been made accidentally or on purpose, and, if on purpose, what the motivations were.

## Decision

From now on, all greater or debatable architectural decisions shall be denoted as an ADR within this document, like the "example ADR" you are currently reading. The used template is from [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard). Also, questions arising about architecture shall be answered in such an ADR format to procude future references.

## Consequences

* (+) Architecture decisions will become more transparent and understandable.
* (+) A truth base is defined and referencable.
* (-) Time needed for documentation.
