# `console` statement standardization

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

In production environments it may seem unclear if an error or warning message is shown in the console from which part of the application they occurred.

## Decision

All `console.warn` and `console.error` messages have to include the package in which they are invoked.

## Consequences

* (+) Errors and warnings can more easily be tracked back to the place in which they occur.
* (-) This restriction must be manually enforced.
