# How to expose additional exports of a package

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

There are multiple ways of exposing additional exports of a package. They can either be exposed in the main file or configured as additional export nodes via rollup and the package.json.

## Decision

All exports should be exposed through the main file of the package as additional named exports.

## Consequences

* (+) A package consumer does not need to know additional paths to import.
* (+) This pattern is established by most major frameworks.
* (-) This restriction must be manually enforced.
