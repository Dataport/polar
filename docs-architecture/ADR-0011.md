# Use Pug engine for HTML pages

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Currently, we write plain HTML as the &lt;template&gt; part of Vue SFCs.

## Decision

We use the templating engine Pug for writing &lt;template&gt;s in Vue SFCs.

HTML pages as demos for the clients stay as they are for now. 

## Consequences

- (+) Pug has a readable and concise syntax, whereas HTML is very verbose.
- (+) Pug enforces correct indentation.
- (-) We introduce additional dependencies.
- (-) Developers who are already used to writing HTML need to get used to Pug.
